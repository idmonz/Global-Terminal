# Options Surface QA

Options, option-chain, volatility-surface, option-book, and model outputs are research calculations only. They are not investment advice, trading recommendations, trade approvals, hedging instructions, or execution instructions.

Goal 12C hardens the supplied-data options workstation. It remains local-only, source-labeled, deterministic, and research-only.

Implemented areas:

- Time-to-expiry derivation from expiry and timestamp.
- Row-level model selection for equity/index, futures, FX, crypto-caveated, and unknown rows.
- Surface QA, no-arbitrage diagnostics, and surface diff payloads.
- Option-book stress using supplied positions and local repricing where available.
- Lightweight HRP/RMT/Kalman-lite/GARCH-lite/cointegration diagnostics without mandatory heavy runtimes.
- Report sanitizer for user-supplied identifiers, CSV formula text, and local path redaction.
- Explicit demo-mode boundary for Options Lab page payloads.


## Goal 12D Patch

Surface QA now prefers price-based call/put vertical monotonicity, strike convexity, calendar price monotonicity, and put-call parity residual checks. IV-only surfaces receive `price_check_unavailable` caveats.
